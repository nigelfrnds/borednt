## How to run

**Note: This project assumes you have docker running on your computer!**

In the root directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose up --build`

Builds the container and runs them.

### `docker-compose up`

Starts containers that already have been built.

**Note: Containers only need to be rebuilt of the dockerfile has been modified! or if you are building the containers for the first time.**
